1. Download the source code submitted under "assignment9-programs" or "assignment9" on D2L.
This ".zip" file includes the ".env" file that provides credentials to connect to the database.

2. Extract the contents of the ".zip" file, and open the folder in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Ensure that you have Node JS (can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) 
installed on your system.

4. Ensure that your CS VPN is connected (OpenVPN for Windows, Tunnelblick for MacOS) â€“ no Oracle queries 
can be executed without it (i.e., the whole application wouldn't work without it).

5. In your terminal, run "npm install" in order to install all the node dependencies for the application.

6. After the packages install, run "npm run dev" in your terminal in order to run the application.
